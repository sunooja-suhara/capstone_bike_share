## Introduction.

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oﬀering. Since then, the program has grown to a ﬂeet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

The goal of this project is to analyze the trends in data, how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently and how to convert casual riders into annual members.

The Project Analysis is done in R. You can check the source code in the file [bikeshare_R.R](bikeshare_R.R)
